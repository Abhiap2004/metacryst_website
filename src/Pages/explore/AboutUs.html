              The club motive is to establish this type of club in every IIT and
              NIT. The team members are eagerly excited to have inter IIT
              tech-meet of Metallurgy Engineering and Materials Science and
              related departments.

              It is an honor for us to be part of the Club. If we look at the
              current scenario, then neck cut competition exists in the world.
              Metallurgy Engineering and Material Science is one of the oldest
              and core branch of engineering, but the number of jobs in this
              field is still lesser than other branches. We have established
              this club in order to enhance the interest of students in the
              department, make them aware of the various innovative researches
              going on in the department. MetaCryst Club team consists of
              students with bright minds, who are always available to guide
              students about their careers in MEMS Department. We extend our
              wishes for the team and hope the club makes a remarkable
              achievement.

              Sitting at Shiru Cafe, brainstorming about arbitrary points, was
              when framing a departmental club came into the image. The
              Department of Metallurgy Engineering and Materials Science (MEMS)
              at IIT Indore has been one of the most encouraging fields for more
              than quite a long while. To give the department an open arbiter as
              a specialized club, We, alongside the first graduating bunch of
              MEMS, raised a club, to be specific 'Metacryst', with the help of
              a goal-oriented arrangement of resources.In a mission to advance
              redistribution of the branch and fabricate shared relations with
              industries, the club was set up to consistently address society's
              issues, tending to points that incorporate quality of life,
              vitality, manageability, and data innovation.We trust 'Metacryst'
              evolves while seeking after these subjects at the most elevated
              level, while at the same time keeping up a collegial and
              profoundly community air.
